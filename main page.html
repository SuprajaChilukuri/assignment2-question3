   	    <h3 style="background-color: #0000ff; color: white;">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
   	    CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document.

        CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed.
        CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

        <h3 style="background-color: #c7a3c4; color: #333333">CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
        CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
        CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
        External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.
        </h3>
        <h2  align="center" style="background-color: #a3b2b7;">Types of CSS</h2>
        <h3 style="background-color: #c7a3c4; color: #333333">There are three ways you can use to implement CSS: internal, external, and inline styles. 
        	<ol>
        		<li>Internal CSS</li>
        		<li>External CSS</li>
        	</ol>
        	<b><u>Internal CSS:</u></b><br/>
            Internal or embedded CSS requires you to add &lt;style> tag in the &lt;head> section of your HTML document.

            This CSS style is an effective method of styling a single page. However, using this style for multiple pages is time-consuming as you need to put CSS rules to every page of your website.<br/>
            <b><u>External CSS:</u></b><br/>
            With external CSS, you’ll link your web pages to an external .css file, which can be created by any text editor.

            This CSS type is a more efficient method, especially for styling a large website. By editing one .css file, you can change your entire site at once.<br/>
            <b><u>Inline CSS:</u></b><br/>
            Inline CSS is used to style a specific HTML element. For this CSS style, you’ll only need to add the style attribute to each HTML tag, without using selectors.

            This CSS type is not really recommended, as each HTML tag needs to be styled individually. Managing your website may become too hard if you only use inline CSS.

            However, inline CSS in HTML can be useful in some situations. For example, in cases where you don’t have access to CSS files or need to apply styles for a single element only.

        <h2 align="center" style="background-color: #a3b2b7;">CSS Syntax</h2>
        <h3 style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #4f61a1;">A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration block.<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        	 selector{ property: value; }
        <ol>
        	<li>The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.</li>

            <li>The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.</li>

            <li>Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.</li>

            <li>Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.</li></h3>
