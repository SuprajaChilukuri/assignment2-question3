          The used value of a CSS property is its value after all calculations have been performed on the computed value.

          After the user agent has finished its calculations, every CSS property has a used value. The used values of dimensions (e.g., width, line-height) are in pixels. The used values of shorthand properties (e.g., background) are consistent with those of their component properties (e.g., background-color or background-size) and with position and float.
